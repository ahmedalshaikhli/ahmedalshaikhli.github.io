I am pleased to be applying for the Web Developer position at River Tech. My extensive experience with designing and developing websites using C#, Java, and Ruby on Rails matches well with your requirements. In addition, my background with working in large development teams has given me the skills to adjust to the changing dynamics and processes of those environments while meeting scheduled milestones and deliverables.

I am highly skilled with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have  good experience with each of these technologies, and I am eager to learn even more technologies to sharpen my skill set.
